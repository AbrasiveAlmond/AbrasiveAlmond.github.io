## Main Goals
- [x] Popups match gnome styling
- [ ] Remove useless clutter in modular manner.
- [x] Basically a combo of gale and gnome theme

### Website behaviour & Todo:
 - [x] Properly test prototype idea
 - [ ] Use onhashchange to swap what blog is shown
   -  This makes it so switching has less network traffic plus they then work with browser back/forward buttons, with working history. If it were more like a webapp that switched contexts without changing url, then the browser would not keep track of which page you are on and it would require custom js logic and keyboard hijacking to create close to normal back/forward actions
 - [ ] RSS support using comrak export to xml feature
