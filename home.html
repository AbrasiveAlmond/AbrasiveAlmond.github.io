<h1>Smaller heading for the homepage</h1>
<p>Welcome to my incredibly simple site, here you should be able to find and peek the different projects I've worked on over the years. Almost use just-the-docs because gnome websites uses it, but it was hella overkill for this job. So simplicity is the goal here.</p>
<p>All the content is written in markdown then converted to html usign the comrak crate.</p>
