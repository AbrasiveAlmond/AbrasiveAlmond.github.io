## Goal: Compact both windows systems and throw them onto partitioned 256GB drive.

Alternatively: Put win11 on 256gb and win10 on Hard drive. 

### Steps to reorder files:
    - Boot Linux :
      * Wipe 860 QVO SSD
      * Pull personal files from windows - delete old versions
      * Move windows 11 to 860QVO - or 256GB drive if it fits.
      * Wipe Lexar drive
  
## Steps to install new distro:
- [x] Move personal files to 860 QVO
- [x] boot live-usb wipe 960 PRO
- [x] Use gnome pika to turn 2TB drive int backup of personal files

# Main Goals
- [x] Make firefox fit into gnome theme better.
- [ ] Remove useless clutter in modular manner.
- [x] Basically a combo of gale and gnome theme

# Sidebery behaviour
- [ ] Auto-collapse and switch to horz tabs when window shrunk
    * width > 1500px
        auto expand into space
    * width < 1500px
        expand on hover w/transition delay on unhover
    * with keybind to collapse manually and return to normal mode
- [x] Popups match gnome styling

## Todo:
 - [x] Create symlink in cur dir to firefox css dir
 - [ ] Properly test idea
